# CSS Todo App

This is a todo app made with HTML and CSS alone. To simplify development, the preprocessors Pug and Sass have been used, but the compiled output is just HTML and CSS. No JavaScript is used.

Of course, this is an "abuse" of CSS and should not be used in production. But it is interesting to see what CSS is capable of.
